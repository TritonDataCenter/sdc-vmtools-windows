* Added lib/run-userdata.ps1 lib/run-userscript.ps1
* Added JoyentTask into task scheduler which runs lib/run-userdata.ps1 and
  lib/run-userscript.ps1 on boot
* Added bin/setup.bat which does most of the work now instead of SetupComplete.
  It activates Windows, sets password, partitions secondary disk, installs
  JoyentTask into task scheduler, and cleans up in the end.
* Added images directory with Joyent icons and Joyent wallpaper
* Added tmp directory which run-userdata.ps1 dumps into file tmp/mdata-get-userdata
* Updated disk driver and network driver to newer versions in 'drivers' directory
* Improved bin/install.bat to install Joyent icons and install contents
* Removed lib/diskpart directory and added lib/diskpart-commands file instead
* Removed un-needed files in various directories (sysprep, drivers)
